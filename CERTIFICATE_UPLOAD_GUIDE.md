# 🔐 Certificate Upload Guide - Fix Banking Integration

## 🎯 Current Issue
✅ **Bank Connections**: Working (accounts are connected)  
❌ **Transaction Sync**: Failing (needs SSL certificates)  
❌ **Certificate Files**: Missing from Render Secret Files

## 📊 Root Cause
The Teller banking API requires **SSL client certificates** for transaction access. Your app is looking for:
- `/etc/secrets/teller_certificate.b64` 
- `/etc/secrets/teller_private_key.b64`

These files exist locally but **haven't been uploaded to Render** yet.

## 🚀 Quick Fix - Upload Certificates

### Step 1: Access Render Dashboard
1. Go to [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Select your `RECEIPT-PROCESSOR` service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Scroll down to **Secret Files** section

### Step 2: Upload Certificate Files
Upload these 2 files from your local machine:

| Local File | Upload Name | Size |
|------------|-------------|------|
| `credentials/teller_certificate.b64` | `teller_certificate.b64` | 2,065 bytes |
| `credentials/teller_private_key.b64` | `teller_private_key.b64` | 2,593 bytes |

### Step 3: Verify Upload
After upload, the files will be available at:
- `/etc/secrets/teller_certificate.b64`
- `/etc/secrets/teller_private_key.b64`

### Step 4: Test Banking Integration
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
2. Test the sync: `POST /api/sync-bank-transactions`
3. Check status: `GET /api/status`

## 🔧 Advanced Troubleshooting

### Test Certificate Loading
```bash
curl -X POST https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/api/debug-certificates
```

### Expected Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "certificates_loaded": true,
  "cert_path": "/etc/secrets/teller_certificate.b64",
  "key_path": "/etc/secrets/teller_private_key.b64",
  "format": "base64_decoded_pem"
}
```

### Test Bank Sync
```bash
curl -X POST https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/api/sync-bank-transactions
```

### Expected Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "accounts": 1,
  "transactions_synced": 50,
  "certificates": "working"
}
```

## 📋 Current Certificate System

### ✅ What's Working
- **Base64 Support**: App automatically detects and decodes base64 files
- **PEM Validation**: Ensures certificates are properly formatted
- **Temporary Files**: Creates secure temp files for requests library
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging
- **Multi-format**: Supports both raw PEM and base64-encoded files

### ✅ Certificate Loading Process
1. **Detection**: App checks if file contains base64 or PEM content
2. **Decoding**: Automatically decodes base64 to PEM format if needed
3. **Validation**: Verifies PEM structure and markers
4. **Temp Files**: Creates secure temporary files for SSL requests
5. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes temp files after use

### ✅ Security Features
- **File Permissions**: Temp files created with 0o600 (owner read/write only)
- **Auto Cleanup**: Temporary files automatically deleted
- **Safe Paths**: All file operations use secure temporary directories
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging without exposing certificate content

## 🎯 Why Upload is Required

### Render Secret Files System
- **Secure Storage**: Certificates stored securely outside container filesystem
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate from code repository
- **Auto-Mount**: Files automatically available at `/etc/secrets/`
- **No Git Exposure**: Prevents accidental commit of sensitive files

### Base64 Format Benefits
- **Text-Safe**: Prevents corruption during upload/transfer
- **UTF-8 Compatible**: Works with Render's text-based secret file system
- **Validation**: Easier to verify content integrity
- **Platform Independent**: Works across different operating systems

## 🚀 Expected Results After Upload

### Immediate (1-2 minutes)
✅ Certificate files available on Render  
✅ App detects and loads certificates successfully  
✅ SSL client authentication working  

### Banking Features Unlocked
✅ **Transaction Sync**: Real-time and historical transaction retrieval  
✅ **Perfect Receipt Matching**: Automatic matching with 85%+ accuracy  
✅ **Account Balance Updates**: Real-time balance information  
✅ **Transaction Categorization**: AI-powered expense categorization  
✅ **Smart Splitting**: Automatic business/personal transaction splits  

### API Endpoints Activated

## 🔍 Debug Information

### Current Environment Variables (Already Configured)
```yaml
TELLER_CERT_PATH: /etc/secrets/teller_certificate.b64
TELLER_KEY_PATH: /etc/secrets/teller_private_key.b64
TELLER_APPLICATION_ID: app_pbvpiocruhfnvkhf1k000
TELLER_ENVIRONMENT: development
```

### Local Certificate Files (Ready for Upload)
```bash
# Verify files exist locally
ls -la credentials/teller_certificate.b64 credentials/teller_private_key.b64

# Check file sizes
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff 2,065 Jun 24 16:14 credentials/teller_certificate.b64
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff 2,593 Jun 24 16:14 credentials/teller_private_key.b64
```

## ⚡ Quick Success Check

After uploading certificates, test everything:

```bash
# 1. Test health
curl https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/health

# 2. Test certificate loading
curl -X POST https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/api/debug-certificates

# 3. Test bank sync
curl -X POST https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/api/sync-bank-transactions

# 4. Check status
curl https://receipt-processor.onrender.com/api/status/real
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics
