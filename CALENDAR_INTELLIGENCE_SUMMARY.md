# ðŸ“… Calendar Context Intelligence System

## Overview
We've successfully built and integrated an intelligent calendar context system that understands meetings and travel to provide contextual expense analysis for Brian Kaplan's businesses.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This System Does

### Smart Business Context Recognition
