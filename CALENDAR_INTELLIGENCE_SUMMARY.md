## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class CalendarEvent:
    event_id: str
    title: str
    start_time: datetime
    end_time: datetime
    location: str
    attendees: List[str]
    description: str
    business_type: str
    event_type: str
    travel_expected: bool
    expense_context: Dict

@dataclass
class BusinessContext:
    is_business_day: bool
    active_projects: List[str]
    meeting_context: str
    travel_status: str
    business_type: str
    expense_justification: str
```

### Pattern Recognition
- **Business Keywords**: Recognizes industry-specific terminology
- **Travel Indicators**: Detects flight, hotel, and travel-related events
- **Meal Contexts**: Identifies business meals and dining expenses
- **Event Classification**: Categorizes events by type (meeting, travel, meal, etc.)

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### 1. Business Context Analysis
```python
from calendar_intelligence import create_calendar_intelligence

ci = create_calendar_intelligence()
context = ci.get_business_context(datetime.now())
print(f"Business Day: {context.is_business_day}")
print(f"Business Type: {context.business_type}")
print(f"Justification: {context.expense_justification}")
```

### 2. Expense Validation
```python
expense_data = {
    'merchant': 'Starbucks',
    'amount': 5.75,
    'category': 'coffee',
    'date': '2025-06-25T10:00:00'
}

analysis = ci.analyze_expense_against_calendar(expense_data)
print(f"Calendar Supports: {analysis['expense_validation']['calendar_supports']}")
print(f"Confidence: {analysis['expense_validation']['confidence']}")
```

### 3. Calendar Events
```python
events = ci.get_events_for_date(datetime.now())
for event in events:
    print(f"Event: {event.title}")
    print(f"Business Type: {event.business_type}")
    print(f"Travel Expected: {event.travel_expected}")
```

## üìä Test Interface

Access the Calendar Intelligence test interface at:
```
http://localhost:10000/test-calendar-intelligence
```

### Test Features
- **Health Check**: Monitor system status and capabilities
- **Business Context**: Analyze business context for any date/time
- **Calendar Events**: View and analyze calendar events
- **Expense Validation**: Test expense validation against calendar
- **Quick Tests**: Pre-configured test scenarios

## üîê Setup Requirements

### Google Calendar API
To enable full functionality, configure Google Calendar API credentials:

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
2. **Enable Calendar API**
3. **Create OAuth2 Credentials**
4. **Store credentials** in one of these locations:
   - `/etc/secrets/calendar_token.json`
   - `credentials/calendar_token.json`
   - Environment variable: `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TOKEN_PATH`

### Fallback Mode
The system works in fallback mode without calendar credentials:
- Uses business day detection (Monday-Friday)
- Provides basic expense justification
- Maintains core functionality
